The Melbourne Datathon 2016 is hackathon which was organised by Melbourne data science meet up as way to bring data scientists together by solving real world problems. The event started with an introductory night on the 21st of April with sneak peak at the dataset, followed by a full hack day on the 23rd which was held in the Telstra Gurrowa Innovation Lab.
	
The dataset contained job ads extracted from the <a href="www.seek.com.au">Seek</a> website which is used by companies for recruitment. The competition was broken in two parts, the first part was a challenge to extract interesting insights from the data where the top 5 teams would present their results.

The second part was a predictive modelling competition which was hosted on the data science website Kaggle. The objective was to classify job ads as "Hospitality and Tourism" class or not using the data provided as well as additional external sources.  

I decided to compete in the second part of the competition as I wanted to apply some of the machine learning techniques had recently acquired.
